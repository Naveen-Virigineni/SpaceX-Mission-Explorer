## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Choices

This project uses a modern, type-safe, and efficient technology stack chosen for scalability and developer experience.

| Technology | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- |
| **React** | A robust and popular library for building declarative and component-based user interfaces. |
| **TypeScript** | For static typing, which improves code quality, readability, and helps prevent common bugs during development. |
| **Vite** | A next-generation frontend tooling that provides an extremely fast development server and optimized build process. |
| **Tailwind CSS** | A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom, responsive designs without leaving your HTML. |
| **Vitest** | A fast and modern testing framework that integrates seamlessly with Vite for a unified development environment. |

## üöß Known Limitations

- **Favorites are Browser-Specific:** The "Favorites" feature uses `localStorage`, meaning favorites are tied to the specific browser and device they are saved on. They are not synced across devices as there is no user authentication or backend database.
- **API Rate Limiting:** As a public client using the free SpaceX API, the application is subject to its rate limits. The debouncing mechanism helps mitigate this, but very rapid filtering could still potentially hit the limit.
